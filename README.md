# What is this?

If you randomly came across this, from wherever, this is an in-progress game in html that is following a friend's currently-in-development text game. It's not complete in any manner, but is being worked on between both of us.

This is still very early in development, so don't expect much of anything at the moment.


# What the fonts?

Multiple fonts are in the fonts folder, but will soon be removed. The main font that will be used is called "Otaku Rant Remade", which is a font I had made myself based off of the "Otaku Rant" font.
